# WordPress Dev

A library containing my standard development resources

### Requirements

```
PHP 5.4 or higher
WordPress 4.0.1
```

The required PHP version will always be the oldest major release that has not received its end-of-life announcement.

The required WordPress version will always be the most recent point release of the previous major release branch.

For both PHP and WordPress requirements, although this library may work with a version below the required versions, they will not be supported and any compatibility is entirely coincidental.
